The `Compilation` module is used by the `Compiler` to create new compilations
(or builds). A `compilation` instance has access to all modules and their
dependencies (most of which are circular references). It is the literal
compilation of all the modules in the dependency graph of an application.
During the compilation phase, modules are loaded, sealed, optimized, chunked,
hashed and restored.

The `Compilation` class also extends `Tapable` and provides the following
lifecycle hooks. They can be tapped the same way as compiler hooks:

``` js
compilation.hooks.someHook.tap(/* ... */);
```

As with the `compiler`, `tapAsync` and `tapPromise` may also be available
depending on the type of hook.


### `buildModule`

`SyncHook`

Triggered before a module build has started, can be used to modify the module.

- Callback Parameters: `module`


```js
compilation.hooks.buildModule.tap('SourceMapDevToolModuleOptionsPlugin',
  module => {
    module.useSourceMap = true;
  }
);
```

- Callback Parameters: `module`


### `finishModules`

`AsyncSeriesHook`

### `beforeModuleAssets`

`SyncHook`

Executed before module assets creation.


### `additionalChunkAssets`

`SyncHook`

Create additional assets for the chunks.

- Callback Parameters: `chunks`


### `shouldGenerateChunkAssets`

`SyncBailHook`

Called to determine whether or not generate chunks assets. Returning anything `!== false` will allow chunk assets generation.


### `beforeChunkAssets`

`SyncHook`

Executed before creating the chunks assets.



### `additionalAssets`

`AsyncSeriesHook`

Create additional assets for the compilation. This hook can be used to download
an image, for example:

``` js
compilation.hooks.additionalAssets.tapAsync('MyPlugin', callback => {
  download('https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg', function(resp) {
    if(resp.status === 200) {
      compilation.assets['webpack-version.svg'] = toAsset(resp);
      callback();
    } else {
      callback(new Error('[webpack-example-plugin] Unable to download the image'));
    }
  });
});
```

### `optimizeChunkAssets`

`AsyncSeriesHook`

Optimize any chunk assets. The assets are stored in `compilation.assets`. A
`Chunk` has a property `files` which points to all files created by a chunk.
Any additional chunk assets are stored in `compilation.additionalChunkAssets`.

- Callback Parameters: `chunks`

Here's an example that simply adds a banner to each chunk.

``` js
compilation.hooks
  .optimizeChunkAssets
  .tapAsync('MyPlugin', (chunks, callback) => {
    chunks.forEach(chunk => {
      chunk.files.forEach(file => {
        compilation.assets[file] = new ConcatSource(
          '\/**Sweet Banner**\/',
          '\n',
          compilation.assets[file]
        );
      });
    });

    callback();
  });
```


### `afterOptimizeChunkAssets`

`SyncHook`

The chunk assets have been optimized.

- Callback Parameters: `chunks`

Here's an example plugin from [@boopathi](https://github.com/boopathi) that outputs exactly what went into each chunk.

``` js
compilation.hooks.afterOptimizeChunkAssets.tap('MyPlugin', chunks => {
  chunks.forEach(chunk => {
    console.log({
      id: chunk.id,
      name: chunk.name,
      includes: chunk.getModules().map(module => module.request)
    });
  });
});
```



### `optimizeAssets`

`AsyncSeriesHook`

Optimize all assets stored in `compilation.assets`.

- Callback Parameters: `assets`


### `afterOptimizeAssets`

`SyncHook`

The assets have been optimized.

- Callback Parameters: `assets`


### `processAssets`

`AsyncSeriesHook`

Asset processing.

- Callback Parameters: `assets`

Here's an example:

```js
compilation.hooks.processAssets.tap(
  {
    name: 'MyPlugin',
    stage: Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONS,
  },
  (assets) => {
    // code here
  }
);
```

There're many stages to use:

- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONAL` - Add additional assets to the compilation.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_PRE_PROCESS` - Basic preprocessing of the assets.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_DERIVED` - Derive new assets from the existing assets.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONS` - Add additional sections to the existing assets e.g. banner or initialization code.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE` - Optimize existing assets in a general way.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_COUNT` - Optimize the count of existing assets, e.g. by merging them.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_COMPATIBILITY` - Optimize the compatibility of existing assets, e.g. add polyfills or vendor prefixes.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_SIZE` - Optimize the size of existing assets, e.g. by minimizing or omitting whitespace.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_SUMMARIZE` - Summarize the list of existing assets.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_DEV_TOOLING` - Add development tooling to the assets, e.g. by extracting a source map.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_OPTIMIZE_TRANSFER` - Optimize the transfer of existing assets, e.g. by preparing a compressed (gzip) file as separate asset.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ANALYSE` - Analyze the existing assets.
- `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_REPORT` - Creating assets for the reporting purposes.

### `afterProcessAssets`

`SyncHook`

Called after the [`processAssets`](#processassets) hook had finished without error.

### `needAdditionalSeal`

`SyncBailHook`

Called to determine if the compilation needs to be unsealed to include other files.


### `afterSeal`

`AsyncSeriesHook`

Executed right after `needAdditionalSeal`.


### `chunkHash`

`SyncHook`

Triggered to emit the hash for each chunk.

- Callback Parameters: `chunk` `chunkHash`


### `moduleAsset`

`SyncHook`

Called when an asset from a module was added to the compilation.

- Callback Parameters: `module` `filename`


### `chunkAsset`

`SyncHook`

Triggered when an asset from a chunk was added to the compilation.

- Callback Parameters: `chunk` `filename`


### `assetPath`

`SyncWaterfallHook`

Called to determine the path of an asset.

- Callback Parameters: `path` `options`


### `needAdditionalPass`

`SyncBailHook`

Called to determine if an asset needs to be processed further after being emitted.


### `childCompiler`

`SyncHook`

Executed after setting up a child compiler.

- Callback Parameters: `childCompiler` `compilerName` `compilerIndex`


### `normalModuleLoader`

Since webpack v5 `normalModuleLoader` hook was removed. Now to access the loader use `NormalModule.getCompilationHooks(compilation).loader` instead.
