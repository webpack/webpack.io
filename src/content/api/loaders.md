A loader is just a JavaScript module that exports a function. The [loader runner](https://github.com/webpack/loader-runner) calls this function and passes the result of the previous loader or the resource file into it. The `this` context of the function is filled-in by webpack and the [loader runner](https://github.com/webpack/loader-runner) with some useful methods that allow the loader (among other things) to change its invocation style to async, or get query parameters.

The first loader is passed one argument: the content of the resource file. The compiler expects a result from the last loader. The result should be a `String` or a `Buffer` (which is converted to a string), representing the JavaScript source code of the module. An optional SourceMap result (as JSON object) may also be passed.

A single result can be returned in **sync mode**. For multiple results the `this.callback()` must be called. In **async mode** `this.async()` must be called to indicate that the [loader runner](https://github.com/webpack/loader-runner) should wait for an asynchronous result. It returns `this.callback()`. Then the loader must return `undefined` and call that callback.


## Examples

The following sections provide some basic examples of the different types of loaders. Note that the `map` and `meta` parameters are optional, see [`this.callback`](/api/loaders#this-callback) below.

### Synchronous Loaders

Either `return` or `this.callback` can be used to return the transformed `content` synchronously:

__sync-loader.js__

``` js
module.exports = function(content, map, meta) {
  return someSyncOperation(content);
};
```

The `this.callback` method is more flexible as it allows multiple arguments to be passed as opposed to just the `content`.

__sync-loader-with-multiple-results.js__

``` js
module.exports = function(content, map, meta) {
  this.callback(null, someSyncOperation(content), map, meta);
  return; // always return undefined when calling callback()
};
```

### Asynchronous Loaders

For asynchronous loaders, [`this.async`](/api/loaders#this-async) is used to retrieve the `callback` function:

__async-loader.js__

``` js
module.exports = function(content, map, meta) {
  var callback = this.async();
  someAsyncOperation(content, function(err, result) {
    if (err) return callback(err);
    callback(null, result, map, meta);
  });
};
```

__async-loader-with-multiple-results.js__

``` js
module.exports = function(content, map, meta) {
  var callback = this.async();
  someAsyncOperation(content, function(err, result, sourceMaps, meta) {
    if (err) return callback(err);
    callback(null, result, sourceMaps, meta);
  });
};
```

T> Loaders were originally designed to work in synchronous loader pipelines, like Node.js (using [enhanced-require](https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-require)), *and* asynchronous pipelines, like in webpack. However, since expensive synchronous computations are a bad idea in a single-threaded environment like Node.js, we advise to make your loader asynchronously if possible. Synchronous loaders are ok if the amount of computation is trivial.


### "Raw" Loader

By default, the resource file is converted to a UTF-8 string and passed to the loader. By setting the `raw` flag, the loader will receive the raw `Buffer`. Every loader is allowed to deliver its result as `String` or as `Buffer`. The compiler converts them between loaders.

__raw-loader.js__

``` js
module.exports = function(content) {
  assert(content instanceof Buffer);
  return someSyncOperation(content);
  // return value can be a `Buffer` too
  // This is also allowed if loader is not "raw"
};
module.exports.raw = true;
```


### Pitching Loader

Loaders are __always__ called from right to left. There are some instances where the loader only cares about the __metadata__ behind a request and can ignore the results of the previous loader. The `pitch` method on loaders is called from __left to right__ before the loaders are actually executed (from right to left). For the following [`use`](/configuration/module#rule-use) configuration:

``` js
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        //...
        use: [
          'a-loader',
          'b-loader',
          'c-loader'
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

These steps would occur:

``` diff
|- a-loader `pitch`
  |- b-loader `pitch`
    |- c-loader `pitch`
      |- requested module is picked up as a dependency
    |- c-loader normal execution
  |- b-loader normal execution
|- a-loader normal execution
```

So why might a loader take advantage of the "pitching" phase?

First, the `data` passed to the `pitch` method is exposed in the execution phase as well under `this.data` and could be useful for capturing and sharing information from earlier in the cycle.

``` js
module.exports = function(content) {
  return someSyncOperation(content, this.data.value);
};

module.exports.pitch = function(remainingRequest, precedingRequest, data) {
  data.value = 42;
};
```

Second, if a loader delivers a result in the `pitch` method the process turns around and skips the remaining loaders. In our example above, if the `b-loader`s `pitch` method returned something:

``` js
module.exports = function(content) {
  return someSyncOperation(content);
};

module.exports.pitch = function(remainingRequest, precedingRequest, data) {
  if (someCondition()) {
    return 'module.exports = require(' + JSON.stringify('-!' + remainingRequest) + ');';
  }
};
```

The steps above would be shortened to:

``` diff
|- a-loader `pitch`
  |- b-loader `pitch` returns a module
|- a-loader normal execution
```

See the [bundle-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/bundle-loader) for a good example of how this process can be used in a more meaningful way.


## The Loader Context

The loader context represents the properties that are available inside of a loader assigned to the `this` property.

Given the following example this require call is used:
In `/abc/file.js`:

``` js
require('./loader1?xyz!loader2!./resource?rrr');
```


### `this.version`

**Loader API version.** Currently `2`. This is useful for providing backwards compatibility. Using the version you can specify custom logic or fallbacks for breaking changes.


### `this.context`

**The directory of the module.** Can be used as context for resolving other stuff.

In the example: `/abc` because `resource.js` is in this directory


### `this.rootContext`

Starting with webpack 4, the formerly `this.options.context` is provided as `this.rootContext`.


### `this.request`

The resolved request string.

In the example: `"/abc/loader1.js?xyz!/abc/node_modules/loader2/index.js!/abc/resource.js?rrr"`


### `this.query`

1. If the loader was configured with an [`options`](/configuration/module/#useentry) object, this will point to that object.
2. If the loader has no `options`, but was invoked with a query string, this will be a string starting with `?`.

T> Use the [`getOptions` method](https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils#getoptions) from `loader-utils` to extract given loader options.


### `this.callback`

A function that can be called synchronously or asynchronously in order to return multiple results. The expected arguments are:

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
this.callback(
  err: Error | null,
  content: string | Buffer,
  sourceMap?: SourceMap,
  meta?: any
);
```

1. The first argument must be an `Error` or `null`
2. The second argument a `string` or a [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html).
3. Optional: The third argument must be a source map that is parsable by [this module](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map).
4. Optional: The fourth option, ignored by webpack, can be anything (e.g. some meta data).

T> It can be useful to pass an abstract syntax tree (AST), like [`ESTree`](https://github.com/estree/estree), as the fourth argument (`meta`) to speed up the build time if you want to share common ASTs between loaders.

In case this function is called, you should return undefined to avoid ambiguous loader results.


### `this.async`

Tells the [loader-runner](https://github.com/webpack/loader-runner) that the loader intends to call back asynchronously. Returns `this.callback`.


### `this.data`

A data object shared between the pitch and the normal phase.


### `this.cacheable`

A function that sets the cacheable flag:

``` typescript
cacheable(flag = true: boolean)
```

By default, loader results are flagged as cacheable. Call this method passing `false` to make the loader's result not cacheable.

A cacheable loader must have a deterministic result, when inputs and dependencies haven't changed. This means the loader shouldn't have other dependencies than specified with `this.addDependency`.


### `this.loaders`

An array of all the loaders. It is writeable in the pitch phase.

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```js
loaders = [{request: string, path: string, query: string, module: function}]
```

In the example:

``` js
[
  {
    request: '/abc/loader1.js?xyz',
    path: '/abc/loader1.js',
    query: '?xyz',
    module: [Function]
  },
  {
    request: '/abc/node_modules/loader2/index.js',
    path: '/abc/node_modules/loader2/index.js',
    query: '',
    module: [Function]
  }
];
```


### `this.loaderIndex`

The index in the loaders array of the current loader.

In the example: in loader1: `0`, in loader2: `1`


### `this.resource`

The resource part of the request, including query.

In the example: `"/abc/resource.js?rrr"`


### `this.resourcePath`

The resource file.

In the example: `"/abc/resource.js"`


### `this.resourceQuery`

The query of the resource.

In the example: `"?rrr"`


### `this.target`

Target of compilation. Passed from configuration options.

Example values: `"web"`, `"node"`


### `this.webpack`

This boolean is set to true when this is compiled by webpack.

T> Loaders were originally designed to also work as Babel transforms. Therefore if you write a loader that works for both, you can use this property to know if there is access to additional loaderContext and webpack features.


### `this.sourceMap`

Should a source map be generated. Since generating source maps can be an expensive task, you should check if source maps are actually requested.


### `this.emitWarning`

``` typescript
emitWarning(warning: Error)
```

Emit a warning.


### `this.emitError`

``` typescript
emitError(error: Error)
```

Emit an error.


### `this.loadModule`

``` typescript
loadModule(request: string, callback: function(err, source, sourceMap, module))
```

Resolves the given request to a module, applies all configured loaders and calls back with the generated source, the sourceMap and the module instance (usually an instance of [`NormalModule`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/NormalModule.js)). Use this function if you need to know the source code of another module to generate the result.


### `this.resolve`

``` typescript
resolve(context: string, request: string, callback: function(err, result: string))
```

Resolve a request like a require expression.


### `this.addDependency`

``` typescript
addDependency(file: string)
dependency(file: string) // shortcut
```

Adds a file as dependency of the loader result in order to make them watchable. For example, [`html-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader) uses this technique as it finds `src` and `src-set` attributes. Then, it sets the url's for those attributes as dependencies of the html file that is parsed.


### `this.addContextDependency`

``` typescript
addContextDependency(directory: string)
```

Add a directory as dependency of the loader result.


### `this.clearDependencies`

``` typescript
clearDependencies()
```

Remove all dependencies of the loader result. Even initial dependencies and these of other loaders. Consider using `pitch`.


### `this.emitFile`

``` typescript
emitFile(name: string, content: Buffer|string, sourceMap: {...})
```

Emit a file. This is webpack-specific.


### `this.fs`

Access to the `compilation`'s `inputFileSystem` property.


## Deprecated context properties

W> The usage of these properties is highly discouraged since we are planning to remove them from the context. They are still listed here for documentation purposes.


### `this.exec`

``` typescript
exec(code: string, filename: string)
```

Execute some code fragment like a module. See [this comment](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org/issues/1268#issuecomment-313513988) for a replacement method if needed.


### `this.resolveSync`

``` typescript
resolveSync(context: string, request: string) -> string
```

Resolve a request like a require expression.


### `this.value`

Pass values to the next loader. If you know what your result exports if executed as module, set this value here (as a only element array).


### `this.inputValue`

Passed from the last loader. If you would execute the input argument as module, consider reading this variable for a shortcut (for performance).


### `this.options`

W> The `options` property has been deprecated in webpack 3 and removed in webpack 4.


### `this.debug`

A boolean flag. It is set when in debug mode.


### `this.minimize`

Should the result be minimized.


### `this._compilation`

Hacky access to the Compilation object of webpack.


### `this._compiler`

Hacky access to the Compiler object of webpack.


### `this._module`

Hacky access to the Module object being loaded.
