The `Compiler` module is the main engine that creates a compilation instance
with all the options passed through the [CLI](/api/cli) or [Node API](/api/node). It extends the
`Tapable` class in order to register and call plugins. Most user facing plugins
are first registered on the `Compiler`.

T> This module is exposed as `webpack.Compiler` and can be used directly. See
[this example](https://github.com/pksjce/webpack-internal-examples/tree/master/compiler-example)
for more information.

When developing a plugin for webpack, you might want to know where each hook is called. To learn this, search for `hooks.<hook name>.call` across the webpack source


## Watching

The `Compiler` supports [watching](/api/node/#watching) which monitors the file
system and recompiles as files change. When in watch mode, the compiler will
emit the additional events such as `watchRun`, `watchClose`, and `invalid`.
This is typically used in [development](/guides/development), usually under
the hood of tools like `webpack-dev-server`, so that the developer doesn't
need to re-compile manually every time. Watch mode can also be entered via the
[CLI](/api/cli/#watch-options).


## Hooks

The following lifecycle hooks are exposed by the `compiler` and can be accessed
as such:

``` js
compiler.hooks.someHook.tap(/* ... */);
```

Depending on the hook type, `tapAsync` and `tapPromise` may also be available.

For the description of hook types, see [the Tapable docs](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#tapable).
