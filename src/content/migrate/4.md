This guide only shows major changes that affect end users. For more details please see [the changelog](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases).


## Node.js v4

If you are still using Node.js v4 or lower, you need to upgrade your Node.js installation to Node.js v6 or higher.


## CLI

The CLI has moved to a separate package: webpack-cli. You need to install it before using webpack, see [basic setup](/guides/getting-started/#basic-setup).


## Update plugins

Many 3rd-party plugins need to be upgraded to their latest version to be compatible.


## mode

Add the new [`mode`](/configuration/mode/) option to your config. Set it to production or development in your configuration depending on config type.

__webpack.config.js__

``` diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  mode: 'production',
}
```

Alternatively you can pass it via CLI: `--mode production`/`--mode development`

## Deprecated/Removed plugins

These plugins can be removed from configuration as they are default in production mode:

__webpack.config.js__

``` diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
-    new NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin(),
-    new ModuleConcatenationPlugin(),
-    new DefinePlugin({ "process.env.NODE_ENV": JSON.stringify("production") })
-    new UglifyJsPlugin()
  ],
}
```

These plugins are default in development mode

__webpack.config.js__

``` diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
-    new NamedModulesPlugin()
  ],
}
```

These plugins were deprecated and are now removed:

__webpack.config.js__

``` diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
-    new NoErrorsPlugin(),
-    new NewWatchingPlugin()
  ],
}
```


## CommonsChunkPlugin

The `CommonsChunkPlugin` was removed. Instead the [`optimization.splitChunks`](/configuration/optimization/#optimization-splitchunks) options can be used.

See documentation of the [`optimization.splitChunks`](/configuration/optimization/#optimization-splitchunks) for more details. The default configuration may already suit your needs.

T> When generating the HTML from the stats you can use `optimization.splitChunks.chunks: "all"` which is the optimal configuration in most cases.

## import() and CommonJS

When using `import()` to load non-ESM the result has changed in webpack 4. Now you need to access the `default` property to get the value of `module.exports`.

__non-esm.js__

``` javascript
module.exports = {
  sayHello: () => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }
};
```

__example.js__

``` javascript
function sayHello() {
  import('./non-esm.js').then(module => {
    module.default.sayHello();
  });
}
```

## json and loaders

When using a custom loader to transform `.json` files you now need to change the module `type`:

__webpack.config.js__

``` diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  rules: [
    {
      test: /config\.json$/,
      loader: 'special-loader',
+     type: 'javascript/auto',
      options: {...}
    }
  ]
};
```

When still using the `json-loader`, it can be removed:

__webpack.config.js__

``` diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  rules: [
    {
-     test: /\.json$/,
-     loader: 'json-loader'
    }
  ]
};
```

## module.loaders

`module.loaders` were deprecated since webpack 2 and are now removed in favor of [`module.rules`](/configuration/module/#rule).
