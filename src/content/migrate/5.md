This guide aims to help you migrating to webpack 5 when using webpack directly. If you are using a higher level tool to run webpack, please refer to the tool for migration instructions.


## Preparations

webpack 5 requires at least Node.js 10.13.0 (LTS).

T> Using newer Node.js version can improve build performance.

### Upgrade webpack and its dependencies

#### Upgrade webpack 4 to the latest available version

When using webpack >= 4, upgrading to the latest webpack 4 version should not require additional guidance.
If you are using webpack version less than 4 please see the [webpack 4 migration guide](/migrate/4/).

#### Upgrade webpack-cli to the latest available version (when used)

#### Upgrade all used Plugins and Loaders to the latest available version

Some Plugins and Loaders might have a beta version that has to be used in order to be compatible with webpack 5.

W> Check related Plugins and Loaders migration guide when upgrading across major versions.

W>  ExtendedAPIPlugin is removed and the logic is merged into [`APIPlugin`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/APIPlugin.js).

#### Make sure your build has no errors or warnings

There might be new errors or warnings because of the upgraded versions of webpack, webpack-cli, Plugins and Loaders. Keep an eye for deprecation warnings during the build.

You can invoke webpack this way to get stack traces for deprecation warnings to figure out which Plugins and Loaders are responsible.

```bash
node --trace-deprecation node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js
```

W> webpack 5 removes all deprecated features. In order to proceed, there should be no webpack deprecation warnings during the build.

#### Make sure you are using entry point information from stats

T> If you are using [HtmlWebpackPlugin](/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/) skip this step.

When using static HTML or creating HTML in other way, make sure to use entry points from stats JSON to generate `<script>`, `<style>` and `<link>` tags.

If this is not possible, avoid setting `splitChunks.chunks: 'all'` and `splitChunks.maxSize` later in this guide. Note that this is sub-optimal and a workaround.

#### Make sure to use `mode`

Set mode to either [`production`](/configuration/mode/#mode-production) or [`development`](/configuration/mode/#mode-development) to make sure that corresponding defaults are set.

#### Update outdated options

Update the following options to their new version (if used):

- `optimization.hashedModuleIds: true` ↦ `optimization.moduleIds: 'hashed'`
- `optimization.namedChunks: true` ↦ `optimization.chunkIds: 'named'`
- `optimization.namedModules: true` ↦ `optimization.moduleIds: 'named'`
- `NamedModulesPlugin` ↦ `optimization.moduleIds: 'named'`
- `NamedChunksPlugin` ↦ `optimization.chunkIds: 'named'`
- `HashedModulesPlugin` ↦ `optimization.moduleIds: 'hashed'`
- `optimization.occurrenceOrder: true` ↦ `optimization: { chunkIds: 'total-size', moduleIds: 'size' }`
- `optimization.splitChunks.cacheGroups.vendors` ↦ `optimization.splitChunks.cacheGroups.defaultVendors`
- `Compilation.entries` ↦ `Compilation.entryDependencies`
- `serve` ↦ `serve` is removed in favor of [`DevServer`](/configuration/dev-server/)

#### Test webpack 5 compatibility

Try to set the following options in your webpack 4 configuration and check if build still works correctly.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  node: {
    Buffer: false,
    process: false
  }
};
```

T> webpack 5 removes these options from the configuration schema and will always use `false`. You have to remove these options again when upgrading your configuration for webpack 5.

#### Upgrade webpack version

npm: `npm install webpack@next --dev`

Yarn: `yarn add webpack@next -D`

#### Clean up configuration

- Consider removing `optimization.moduleIds` and `optimization.chunkIds` from your webpack configuration. The defaults could be better, because they support long term caching in [`production mode`](/configuration/mode/#mode-production) and debugging in [`development` mode](/configuration/mode/#mode-development).
- When using `[hash]` placeholder in webpack configuration, consider changing it to `[contenthash]`. It is not the same, but proven to be more effective.
- If you are using Yarn's PnP and the `pnp-webpack-plugin`, we have good news: it is supported by default now. You have to remove it from the configuration.
- If you are using `IgnorePlugin` with a regular expression as argument, it takes an `options` object now: `new IgnorePlugin({ resourceRegExp: /regExp/ })`.

If you were using WASM via import you should follow this two step process:

- Enable the deprecated spec by setting `experiments.syncWebAssembly: true`, to get the same behavior as in webpack 4.
- After successful migration to webpack 5, change the `experiments` value to `experiments: { asyncWebAssembly: true, importAsync: true }` to use the up-to-date spec for WASM integration.

Reconsider `optimization.splitChunks`:

- It's recommended to use either the defaults or `optimization.splitChunks: { chunks: 'all' }`.
- When using HTTP/2 and long term caching, set `optimization.splitChunks: { chunks: 'all', maxInitialRequests: 30, maxAsyncRequests: 30, maxSize: 100000 }`.
- When using a custom configuration, replace `name` with `idHint`.
- It was possible to turn off the defaults by setting `optimization.splitChunks: { default: false, vendors: false }`. We don't recommend doing this, but if you really want to get the same effect in webpack 5: `optimization.splitChunks: { default: false, defaultVendors: false }`.

#### Cleanup the code

Using `/* webpackChunkName: '...' */`: Make sure to understand the intention:

- The chunk's name here is intended to be public.
- It's not a development-only name.
- webpack will use it to name files in production and development modes.
- webpack 5 will automatically assign useful file names in `development` mode even when not using `webpackChunkName`.

Using named exports from JSON modules: this is not supported by the new specification and you will get a warning. Instead of `import { version } from './package.json'` use `import package from './package.json'; const { version } = package;`

#### Cleanup the build code

- When using `const compiler = webpack(...);`, make sure to close the compiler after using it: `compiler.close();`.

#### Run a single build and follow advises

If there is no corresponding advise? Please create an issue and we will try to resolve it. Repeat this step until you solved at least level 3 or 4:

- Level 1: Schema validation fails. Configuration options have changed. There should be a validation error with a `BREAKING CHANGE:` note.
- Level 2: webpack exits with an error. The error message should tell you what needs to be changed.
- Level 3: Build Errors. The error message should have a `BREAKING CHANGE:` note.
- Level 4: Build Warnings. The warning message should tell you what can be improved.

Deprecation warnings. You might get a lot of deprecation warnings. This is not a problem right now. Plugins need time to catch up with core changes. Please ignore them until release candidate out of Beta.

- You can hide deprecation warnings by running node with `--no-deprecation` flag, e.g.: `node --no-deprecation node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js`. This should only be a temporary workaround.
- Plugins and Loaders contributors can follow the advises in the deprecation messages to improve the code.

#### Turn off ES2015 syntax in runtime code, if necessary

By default, webpack's runtime code uses ES2015 syntax to build smaller bundles. If your build targets environments that don't support this syntax (like IE11), you'll need to set `output.ecmaVersion: 5` to revert to ES5 syntax.

#### Everything works?

Please tweet that you have successfully migrated to webpack 5. [Tweet it](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=https://webpack.js.org/migrate/5/&text=I%20just%20migrated%20to%20webpack%205%20using%20its%20migration%20guide!%20&via=webpack&hashtags=webpack,webpack5)

#### It is not working?

Create an [issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md) and tell us about the issues you have encountered during the migration.

#### Something missing in this guide?

## Changes to internals

The changes to webpack internals such as: adding types, refactoring code and methods renaming are listed here for anyone interested. But they are not intended as a part of common use-case migration.

- `Module.nameForCondition`, `Module.updateCacheModule` and `Module.chunkCondition` are no longer optional.

### getOptions method for Loaders

webpack 5 ships with built-in [`this.getOptions`](/api/loaders/#thisgetoptionsschema) method available in loader context. This is a breaking change for loaders that had been using `getOptions` method from previously preferred [schema-utils](https://github.com/webpack/schema-utils):

- `this.getOptions` is available since webpack 5
- Instead of JSON5 it supports JSON as a query string: `?{arg:true}` ↦ `?{"arg":true}`. Using JSON5 should be considered and documented as deprecated in favor of JSON in respective Loader's documentation.
- [`loader-utils`](https://github.com/webpack/loader-utils) has specific behavior for parsing query strings (`true`, `false` and `null` won't be parsed as `string` but as a primitive value). This is no longer the case for the new built-in `this.getOptions` method, which uses native [`querystring`](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html) parsing (ships with Node.js). It is still possible to add custom behavior for these cases in the Loader's code after getting the options by using `this.getOptions` method.
- Schema argument is optional for the new `this.getOptions` method, but we strongly advise to add schema validation for your Loader's options. The `title` field in the schema, can be used to customize the validation error message e.g. `"title": "My Loader ooooptions"` will result in displaying errors this way: `Invalid ooooptions object. My Loader has been initialised using an ooooptions object that does not match the API schema. - ooooptions.foo.bar.baz should be a string.`
