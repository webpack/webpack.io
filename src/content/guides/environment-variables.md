To disambiguate in your `webpack.config.js` between [development](/guides/development) and [production builds](/guides/production) you may use environment variables.

The webpack command line [environment option](/api/cli/#environment-options) `--env` allows you to pass in as many environment variables as you like. Environment variables will be made accessible in your `webpack.config.js`. For example, `--env.production` or `--env.NODE_ENV=local` (`NODE_ENV` is conventionally used to define the environment type, see [here](https://dzone.com/articles/what-you-should-know-about-node-env).)

```bash
webpack --env.NODE_ENV=local --env.production --progress
```

T> Setting up your `env` variable without assignment, `--env.production` sets `--env.production` to `true` by default. There are also other syntaxes that you can use. See the [webpack CLI](/api/cli/#environment-options) documentation for more information.

There is one change that you will have to make to your webpack config. Typically, `module.exports` points to the configuration object. To use the `env` variable, you must convert `module.exports` to a function:

__webpack.config.js__

``` js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = env => {
  // Use env.<YOUR VARIABLE> here:
  console.log('NODE_ENV: ', env.NODE_ENV); // 'local'
  console.log('Production: ', env.production); // true

  return {
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {
      filename: 'bundle.js',
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
    }
  };
};
```
