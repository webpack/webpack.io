As of webpack 5, you can use [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) without [`worker-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/worker-loader).

## Syntax

```js
new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));
```

The syntax was chosen to allow running code without bundler, it is also available in native ECMAScript modules in the browser.

## Example

**src/index.js**

```js
const worker = new Worker(new URL('./deep-thought.js', import.meta.url));
worker.postMessage({
  question:
    'The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything.',
});
worker.onmessage = ({ data: { answer } }) => {
  console.log(answer);
};
```

**src/deep-thought.js**

```js
self.onmessage = ({ data: { question } }) => {
  self.postMessage({
    answer: 42,
  });
};
```
