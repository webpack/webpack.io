webpack is capable of adding `nonce` to all scripts that it loads. To activate the feature set a `__webpack_nonce__` variable needs to be included in your entry script. A unique hash based nonce should be generated and provided for each unique page view this is why `__webpack_nonce__` is specified in the entry file and not in the configuration. Please note that `nonce` should always be a base64-encoded string.


## Examples

In the entry file:

``` js
// ...
__webpack_nonce__ = 'c29tZSBjb29sIHN0cmluZyB3aWxsIHBvcCB1cCAxMjM=';
// ...
```


## Enabling CSP

Please note that CSPs are not enabled by default. A corresponding header `Content-Security-Policy` or meta tag `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" ...>` needs to be sent with the document to instruct the browser to enable the CSP. Here's an example of what a CSP header including a CDN white-listed URL might look like:

```html
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted.cdn.com;
```

For more information on CSP and `nonce` attribute, please refer to __Further Reading__ section at the bottom of this page.
