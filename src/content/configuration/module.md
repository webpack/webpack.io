These options determine how the [different types of modules](/concepts/modules) within a project will be treated.


## `module.noParse`

`RegExp | [RegExp]`

`RegExp | [RegExp] | function` (since webpack 3.0.0)

Prevent webpack from parsing any files matching the given regular expression(s). Ignored files **should not** have calls to `import`, `require`, `define` or any other importing mechanism. This can boost build performance when ignoring large libraries.

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    noParse: /jquery|lodash/,

    // since webpack 3.0.0
    noParse: function(content) {
      return /jquery|lodash/.test(content);
    }
  }
};
```

## `module.rules`

`array`

An array of [Rules](#rule) which are matched to requests when modules are created. These rules can modify how the module is created. They can apply loaders to the module, or modify the parser.


## Rule

A Rule can be separated into three parts â€” Conditions, Results and nested Rules.


### Rule Conditions

There are two input values for the conditions:

1. The resource: An absolute path to the file requested. It's already resolved according to the [`resolve` rules](/configuration/resolve).

2. The issuer: An absolute path to the file of the module which requested the resource. It's the location of the import.

**Example:** When we `import './style.css'` within `app.js`, the resource is `/path/to/style.css` and the issuer is `/path/to/app.js`.

In a Rule the properties [`test`](#rule-test), [`include`](#rule-include), [`exclude`](#rule-exclude) and [`resource`](#rule-resource) are matched with the resource and the property [`issuer`](#rule-issuer) is matched with the issuer.

When using multiple conditions, all conditions must match.

W> Be careful! The resource is the _resolved_ path of the file, which means symlinked resources are the real path _not_ the symlink location. This is good to remember when using tools that symlink packages (like `npm link`), common conditions like `/node_modules/` may inadvertently miss symlinked files. Note that you can turn off symlink resolving (so that resources are resolved to the symlink path) via [`resolve.symlinks`](/configuration/resolve#resolve-symlinks).


### Rule results

Rule results are used only when the Rule condition matches.

There are two output values of a Rule:

1. Applied loaders: An array of loaders applied to the resource.
2. Parser options: An options object which should be used to create the parser for this module.

These properties affect the loaders: [`loader`](#rule-loader), [`options`](#rule-options-rule-query), [`use`](#rule-use).

For compatibility also these properties: [`query`](#rule-options-rule-query), [`loaders`](#rule-loaders).

The [`enforce`](#rule-enforce) property affects the loader category. Whether it's a normal, pre- or post- loader.

The [`parser`](#rule-parser) property affects the parser options.


## Nested rules

Nested rules can be specified under the properties [`rules`](#rule-rules) and [`oneOf`](#rule-oneof).

These rules are evaluated when the Rule condition matches.


## `Rule.enforce`

Possible values: `"pre" | "post"`

Specifies the category of the loader. No value means normal loader.

There is also an additional category "inlined loader" which are loaders applied inline of the import/require.

There are two phases that all loaders enter one after the other:

1. __Pitching__ phase: the pitch method on loaders is called in the order `post, inline, normal, pre`. See [Pitching Loader](/api/loaders/#pitching-loader) for details.
2. __Normal__ phase: the normal method on loaders is executed in the order `pre, normal, inline, post`. Transformation on the source code of a module happens in this phase.

All normal loaders can be omitted (overridden) by prefixing `!` in the request.

All normal and pre loaders can be omitted (overridden) by prefixing `-!` in the request.

All normal, post and pre loaders can be omitted (overridden) by prefixing `!!` in the request.

Inline loaders and `!` prefixes should not be used as they are non-standard. They may be use by loader generated code.


## `Rule.exclude`

`Rule.exclude` is a shortcut to `Rule.resource.exclude`. If you supply a `Rule.exclude` option, you cannot also supply a `Rule.resource`. See [`Rule.resource`](#rule-resource) and [`Condition.exclude`](#condition) for details.


## `Rule.include`

`Rule.include` is a shortcut to `Rule.resource.include`. If you supply a `Rule.include` option, you cannot also supply a `Rule.resource`. See [`Rule.resource`](#rule-resource) and [`Condition.include`](#condition) for details.


## `Rule.issuer`

A [`Condition`](#condition) to match against the module that issued the request. In the following example, the `issuer` for the `a.js` request would be the path to the `index.js` file.

__index.js__

```js
import A from './a.js';
```

This option can be used to apply loaders to the dependencies of a specific module or set of modules.


## `Rule.loader`

`Rule.loader` is a shortcut to `Rule.use: [ { loader } ]`. See [`Rule.use`](#rule-use) and [`UseEntry.loader`](#useentry) for details.


## `Rule.loaders`

W> This option is __deprecated__ in favor of `Rule.use`.

`Rule.loaders` is an alias to `Rule.use`. See [`Rule.use`](#rule-use) for details.


## `Rule.oneOf`

An array of [`Rules`](#rule) from which only the first matching Rule is used when the Rule matches.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /.css$/,
        oneOf: [
          {
            resourceQuery: /inline/, // foo.css?inline
            use: 'url-loader'
          },
          {
            resourceQuery: /external/, // foo.css?external
            use: 'file-loader'
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## `Rule.options` / `Rule.query`

`Rule.options` and `Rule.query` are shortcuts to `Rule.use: [ { options } ]`. See [`Rule.use`](#rule-use) and [`UseEntry.options`](#useentry) for details.

W> `Rule.query` is deprecated in favor of `Rule.options` and `UseEntry.options`.


## `Rule.parser`

An object with parser options. All applied parser options are merged.

Parsers may inspect these options and disable or reconfigure themselves accordingly. Most of the default plugins interpret the values as follows:

* Setting the option to `false` disables the parser.
* Setting the option to `true` or leaving it `undefined` enables the parser.

However, parser plugins may accept more than just a boolean. For example, the internal `NodeStuffPlugin` can accept an object instead of `true` to add additional options for a particular Rule.

**Examples** (parser options by the default plugins):

```js-with-links
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        //...
        parser: {
          amd: false, // disable AMD
          commonjs: false, // disable CommonJS
          system: false, // disable SystemJS
          harmony: false, // disable ES2015 Harmony import/export
          requireInclude: false, // disable require.include
          requireEnsure: false, // disable require.ensure
          requireContext: false, // disable require.context
          browserify: false, // disable special handling of Browserify bundles
          requireJs: false, // disable requirejs.*
          node: false, // disable __dirname, __filename, module, require.extensions, require.main, etc.
          node: {...} // reconfigure [node](/configuration/node) layer on module level
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


## `Rule.resource`

A [`Condition`](#condition) matched with the resource. You can either supply a `Rule.resource` option or use the shortcut options `Rule.test`, `Rule.exclude`, and `Rule.include`. See details in [`Rule` conditions](#rule-conditions).


## `Rule.resourceQuery`

A [`Condition`](#condition) matched with the resource query. This option is used to test against the query section of a request string (i.e. from the question mark onwards). If you were to `import Foo from './foo.css?inline'`, the following condition would match:

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /.css$/,
        resourceQuery: /inline/,
        use: 'url-loader'
      }
    ]
  }
};
```


## `Rule.rules`

An array of [`Rules`](#rule) that is also used when the Rule matches.


## `Rule.sideEffects`

Possible values: `true | false`

Indicate what parts of the module contain side effects. See [Tree Shaking](/guides/tree-shaking/#mark-the-file-as-side-effect-free) for details.


## `Rule.test`

`Rule.test` is a shortcut to `Rule.resource.test`. If you supply a `Rule.test` option, you cannot also supply a `Rule.resource`. See [`Rule.resource`](#rule-resource) and [`Condition.test`](#condition) for details.


## `Rule.type`

Possible values: `"javascript/auto" | "javascript/dynamic" | "javascript/esm" | "json" | "webassembly/experimental"`

`Rule.type` sets the type for a matching module. This prevents defaultRules and their default importing behaviors from occurring. For example, if you want to load a `.json` file through a custom loader, you'd need to set the `type` to `javascript/auto` to bypass webpack's built-in json importing. (See [v4.0 changelog](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v4.0.0) for more details)

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      //...
      {
        test: /\.json$/,
        type: 'javascript/auto',
        loader: 'custom-json-loader'
      }
    ]
  }
};
```


## `Rule.use`

A list of [UseEntries](#useentry) which are applied to modules. Each entry specifies a loader to be used.

Passing a string (i.e. `use: [ "style-loader" ]`) is a shortcut to the loader property (i.e. `use: [ { loader: "style-loader "} ]`).

Loaders can be chained by passing multiple loaders, which will be applied from right to left (last to first configured).

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        //...
        use: [
          'style-loader',
          {
            loader: 'css-loader',
            options: {
              importLoaders: 1
            }
          },
          {
            loader: 'less-loader',
            options: {
              noIeCompat: true
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

See [UseEntry](#useentry) for details.


## `Condition`

Conditions can be one of these:

* A string: To match the input must start with the provided string. I. e. an absolute directory path, or absolute path to the file.
* A RegExp: It's tested with the input.
* A function: It's called with the input and must return a truthy value to match.
* An array of Conditions: At least one of the Conditions must match.
* An object: All properties must match. Each property has a defined behavior.

`{ test: Condition }`: The Condition must match. The convention is to provide a RegExp or array of RegExps here, but it's not enforced.

`{ include: Condition }`: The Condition must match. The convention is to provide a string or array of strings here, but it's not enforced.

`{ exclude: Condition }`: The Condition must NOT match. The convention is to provide a string or array of strings here, but it's not enforced.

`{ and: [Condition] }`: All Conditions must match.

`{ or: [Condition] }`: Any Condition must match.

`{ not: [Condition] }`: All Conditions must NOT match.

**Example:**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        include: [
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'app/styles'),
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'vendor/styles')
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```


## `UseEntry`

`object`

It must have a `loader` property being a string. It is resolved relative to the configuration [`context`](/configuration/entry-context#context) with the loader resolving options ([resolveLoader](/configuration/resolve#resolveloader)).

It can have an `options` property being a string or object. This value is passed to the loader, which should interpret it as loader options.

For compatibility a `query` property is also possible, which is an alias for the `options` property. Use the `options` property instead.

**Example:**

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        loader: 'css-loader',
        options: {
          modules: true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

Note that webpack needs to generate a unique module identifier from the resource and all loaders including options. It tries to do this with a `JSON.stringify` of the options object. This is fine in 99.9% of cases, but may be not unique if you apply the same loaders with different options to the resource and the options have some stringified values.

It also breaks if the options object cannot be stringified (i.e. circular JSON). Because of this you can have a `ident` property in the options object which is used as unique identifier.


## Module Contexts

> Avoid using these options as they are __deprecated__ and will soon be removed.

These options describe the default settings for the context created when a dynamic dependency is encountered.

Example for an `unknown` dynamic dependency: `require`.

Example for an `expr` dynamic dependency: `require(expr)`.

Example for an `wrapped` dynamic dependency: `require("./templates/" + expr)`.

Here are the available options with their [defaults](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/WebpackOptionsDefaulter.js):

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    exprContextCritical: true,
    exprContextRecursive: true,
    exprContextRegExp: false,
    exprContextRequest: '.',
    unknownContextCritical: true,
    unknownContextRecursive: true,
    unknownContextRegExp: false,
    unknownContextRequest: '.',
    wrappedContextCritical: false,
    wrappedContextRecursive: true,
    wrappedContextRegExp: /.*/,
    strictExportPresence: false // since webpack 2.3.0
  }
};
```

T> You can use the `ContextReplacementPlugin` to modify these values for individual dependencies. This also removes the warning.

A few use cases:

* Warn for dynamic dependencies: `wrappedContextCritical: true`.
* `require(expr)` should include the whole directory: `exprContextRegExp: /^\.\//`
* `require("./templates/" + expr)` should not include subdirectories by default: `wrappedContextRecursive: false`
* `strictExportPresence` makes missing exports an error instead of warning
