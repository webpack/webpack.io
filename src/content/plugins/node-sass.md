webpack has a rich plugin interface. Most of the features within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack flexible.

Node-sass is a library that provides binding for Node.js to LibSass, the C version of the popular stylesheet preprocessor, Sass.

It allows you to natively compile .scss files to css at incredible speed and automatically via a connect middleware.

#### Install

```Shell Command
yarn add node-sass
```

Since webpack requires the node-gyp prerequisites so there is a need to install the node-sass library.
Compiling on Windows machines requires the node-gyp prerequisites.
