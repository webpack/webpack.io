As webpack is such a versatile tool, it provides a variety of interfaces. Which interface you use depends on what your goal is. When using webpack to compile, bundle and analyze a project, you would most likely use the [CLI](/documentation/api/cli) or [NodeJS interface](/documentation/api/node) along with a configuration file. However, if the goal is to write a plugin or loader, you would be working with the [loader](/documentation/api/loaders) or [plugin](/documentation/api/plugins) interfaces.

These are the various interfaces webpack exposes:

* [CLI](/documentation/api/cli)
* [Node](/documentation/api/node)
* [Loaders](/documentation/api/loaders)
* [Plugins](/documentation/api/plugins)
