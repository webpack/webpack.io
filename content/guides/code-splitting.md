Code splitting is one of the most compelling features of webpack. It allows you to split your code into various bundles which you can then load on demand â€” like when a user navigates to a matching route, or on an event from the user. This allows for smaller bundles, and allows you to control resource load prioritization, which if used correctly, can have a major impact on your application load time.

There are mainly two kinds of code splitting that can be accomplished with webpack:

## Resource splitting for caching and parallel loads

### Vendor code splitting

A typical application can depend on many third party libraries for framework/functionality needs. Unlike the application code, code present in these libraries do not change very often. 

If we keep code from these libraries onto its own bundle, separate from the application code, we can leverage browser's caching mechanism to cache these files for longer durations on the end user's machine. 

For this to work, the `hash` portion in the vendor filename must remain constant, regardless of application code changes. Learn [how to split vendor/library](/guides/code-splitting-libraries) code using the CommonsChunkPlugin.

### CSS splitting

You might also want to split your styles into a separate bundle, independent from application logic. 
This enhances cacheability of your styles and allows the browser to load the styles in-parallel with your application code, thus preventing a FOUC (flash of unstyled content).

## On demand code-splitting

While resource splitting of the previous kind requires the user to specify the split points upfront in the configuration, one can also create dynamic split points in the application code.

This can be used for more granular chunking of code, for eg. as per our application routes or as per predicted user behaviour. This allows the user to load non-essential assets on demand.

### Code splitting with `require.ensure()`

`require.ensure()` is the CommonJS way of including assets asynchronously. By adding `require.ensure([<fileurl>])`, we can define a split point in the code. webpack can then create a separate bundle of all the code inside this split point.
