Code splitting is one of the most compelling features of webpack. This feature allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. It can be used to achieve smaller bundles and control resource load prioritization which, if used correctly, can have a major impact on load time.

There are three general approaches to code splitting available:

- Entry Points: Manually split code using [`entry`](/configuration/entry-context) configuration.
- Prevent Duplication: Use the [`CommonsChunkPlugin`](/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin) to dedupe and split chunks.
- Dynamic Imports: Split code via inline function calls within modules.


## Entry Points

This is by far the easiest, and most intuitive, way to split code. However, it is more manual and has a some pitfalls we will go over. Let's take a look at how we might split another module from the main bundle:

__project__

``` diff
webpack-demo
|- package.json
|- webpack.config.js
|- /dist
|- /src
  |- index.js
+ |- another-module.js
|- /node_modules
```

__another-module.js__

``` js
import _ from 'lodash';

console.log(
  _.join(['Another', 'module', 'loaded!'], ' ')
);
```

__webpack.config.js__

``` js
const path = require('path');
const HTMLWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    index: './src/index.js',
    another: './src/another-module.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new HTMLWebpackPlugin({
      title: 'Code Splitting'
    })
  ],
  output: {
    filename: '[name].bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
};
```

This will yield the following build result:

``` bash
Hash: 309402710a14167f42a8
Version: webpack 2.6.1
Time: 570ms
            Asset    Size  Chunks                    Chunk Names
  index.bundle.js  544 kB       0  [emitted]  [big]  index
another.bundle.js  544 kB       1  [emitted]  [big]  another
   [0] ./~/lodash/lodash.js 540 kB {0} {1} [built]
   [1] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 509 bytes {0} {1} [built]
   [2] (webpack)/buildin/module.js 517 bytes {0} {1} [built]
   [3] ./src/another-module.js 87 bytes {1} [built]
   [4] ./src/index.js 216 bytes {0} [built]
```

As mentioned there are some pitfalls to this approach:

- If there are any duplicated modules between entry chunks they will be included in both bundles.
- It isn't as flexible and can't be used to dynamically split code with the core application logic.

The first of these two points is definitely an issue for our example, as `lodash` is also imported within `./src/index.js` and will thus be duplicated in both bundles. Let's remove this duplication by using the `CommonsChunkPlugin`.


## Prevent Duplication

The [`CommonsChunkPlugin`](/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin) allows us to extract common dependencies into an existing entry chunk or an entirely new chunk. Let's use this to de-duplicate the `lodash` dependency from the previous example:

__webpack.config.js__

``` diff
  const path = require('path');
+ const webpack = require('webpack');
  const HTMLWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

  module.exports = {
    entry: {
      index: './src/index.js',
      another: './src/another-module.js'
    },
    plugins: [
      new HTMLWebpackPlugin({
        title: 'Code Splitting'
-     })
+     }),
+     new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
+       name: 'common' // Specify the common bundle's name.
+     })
    ],
    output: {
      filename: '[name].bundle.js',
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
    }
  };
```

With the `CommonsChunkPlugin` in place, we should now see the duplicate dependency removed from our `index.bundle.js`. The plugin should notice that we've separated `lodash` out to a separate chunk and remove the dead weight from our main bundle. Let's do an `npm run build` to see if it worked:

``` bash
Hash: 70a59f8d46ff12575481
Version: webpack 2.6.1
Time: 510ms
            Asset       Size  Chunks                    Chunk Names
  index.bundle.js  665 bytes       0  [emitted]         index
another.bundle.js  537 bytes       1  [emitted]         another
 common.bundle.js     547 kB       2  [emitted]  [big]  common
   [0] ./~/lodash/lodash.js 540 kB {2} [built]
   [1] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 509 bytes {2} [built]
   [2] (webpack)/buildin/module.js 517 bytes {2} [built]
   [3] ./src/another-module.js 87 bytes {1} [built]
   [4] ./src/index.js 216 bytes {0} [built]
```

Here are some other useful plugins and loaders provide by the community for splitting code:

- [`ExtractTextPlugin`](/plugins/extract-text-webpack-plugin): Useful for splitting CSS out from the main application.
- [`bundle-loader`](/loaders/bundle-loader): Used to split code and lazy load the resulting bundles.
- [`promise-loader`](https://github.com/gaearon/promise-loader): Similar to the `bundle-loader` but uses promises.


## Dynamic Imports

Two similar techniques are supported by webpack when it comes to dynamic code splitting. The first and more preferable approach is use to the [`import()` syntax](/api/module-methods#import-) that conforms to the [ECMAScript proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) for dynamic imports. The legacy, webpack-specific approach is to use [`require.ensure`](/api/module-methods#require-ensure). Let's try using the first of these two approaches...

Before we start, let's remove the extra `entry` and `CommonsChunkPlugin` from our config as they won't be needed for this next demonstration:

__webpack.config.js__

``` diff
  const path = require('path');
- const webpack = require('webpack');
  const HTMLWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

  module.exports = {
    entry: {
+     index: './src/index.js'
-     index: './src/index.js',
-     another: './src/another-module.js'
    },
    plugins: [
      new HTMLWebpackPlugin({
        title: 'Code Splitting'
-     }),
+     })
-     new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
-       name: 'common' // Specify the common bundle's name.
-     })
    ],
    output: {
      filename: '[name].bundle.js',
+     chunkFilename: '[name].bundle.js',
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
    }
  };
```

We'll also update our project to remove the now unused files:

__project__

``` diff
webpack-demo
|- package.json
|- webpack.config.js
|- /dist
|- /src
  |- index.js
- |- another-module.js
|- /node_modules
```

Now, instead of statically importing lodash, we'll use dynamic importing to separate a chunk:

__src/index.js__

``` diff
- import _ from 'lodash';
-
- function component() {
+ function getComponent() {
-   var element = document.createElement('div');
-
-   // Lodash, now imported by this script
-   element.innerHTML = _.join(['Hello', 'webpack'], ' ');
+   return import(/* webpackChunkName: "lodash" */ 'lodash').then(_ => {
+     var element = document.createElement('div');
+
+     element.innerHTML = _.join(['Hello', 'webpack'], ' ');
+
+     return element;
+
+   }).catch(error => 'An error occurred while loading the component');
  }

- document.body.appendChild(component());
+ getComponent().then(component => {
+   document.body.appendChild(component);
+ })
```

Note the use of `webpackChunkName` in the comment. This will cause our separate bundle to be named `lodash.bundle.js` instead of just `[id].bundle.js`. For more information on `webpackChunkName` and the other available options, see the [`import()` documentation](/api/module-methods#import-). Let's run webpack to see lodash separated out to a separate bundle:

``` bash
Hash: a27e5bf1dd73c675d5c9
Version: webpack 2.6.1
Time: 544ms
           Asset     Size  Chunks                    Chunk Names
lodash.bundle.js   541 kB       0  [emitted]  [big]  lodash
 index.bundle.js  6.35 kB       1  [emitted]         index
   [0] ./~/lodash/lodash.js 540 kB {0} [built]
   [1] ./src/index.js 377 bytes {1} [built]
   [2] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 509 bytes {0} [built]
   [3] (webpack)/buildin/module.js 517 bytes {0} [built]
```

If you've enabled [`async` functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) via a pre-processor like babel, note that you can simplify the code as `import()` statements just return promises:

__src/index.js__

``` diff
- function getComponent() {
+ async function getComponent() {
-   return import(/* webpackChunkName: "lodash" */ 'lodash').then(module => {
-     var element = document.createElement('div');
-
-     element.innerHTML = _.join(['Hello', 'webpack'], ' ');
-
-     return element;
-
-   }).catch(error => 'An error occurred while loading the component');
+   var element = document.createElement('div');
+   const _ = await import(/* webpackChunkName: "lodash" */ 'lodash');
+
+   element.innerHTML = _.join(['Hello', 'webpack'], ' ');
+
+   return element;
  }

  getComponent().then(component => {
    document.body.appendChild(component);
  });
```
