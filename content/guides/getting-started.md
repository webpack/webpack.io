As you may already know, webpack is used to compile JavaScript modules. Once [installed](/guides/installation), you can interface with webpack either from its [CLI](/api/cli) or [API](/api/node). If you're still new to webpack, please read through the [core concepts](/concepts) and [this comparison](/guides/comparison) to learn why you might use it over the other tools that are out in the community.


## Basic Setup

First let's create a directory, initialize NPM, and [install webpack locally](/guides/installation#local-installation):

``` bash
mkdir webpack-demo && cd webpack-demo
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev webpack
```

Now we'll create the following directory structure and contents:

``` diff
webpack-demo
|- package.json
+ |- index.html
+ |- /src
+   |- index.js
```

__src/index.js__

```javascript
function component () {
  var element = document.createElement('div');

  /* lodash is required for the next line to work */
  element.innerHTML = _.join(['Hello', 'webpack'], ' ');

  return element;
}

document.body.appendChild(component());
```

__index.html__

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>webpack 2 demo</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/lodash@4.16.6"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="/src/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, there are implicit dependencies between the `<script>` tags. Our `index.js` file depends on `lodash` being included in the page before it runs. This is because `index.js` never declared a need for `lodash`; it just assumes that the global variable `_` exists.

There are problems with managing JavaScript projects this way:

- It is not immediately apparent that the script depends on an external library.
- If a dependency is missing, or included in the wrong order, the application will not function properly.
- If a dependency is included but not used, the browser will be forced to download unnecessary code.

Let's try using webpack to manage these scripts instead...


## Creating a Bundle

First we'll tweak our directory structure slightly, separating the "source" code we write and edit (`/src`) from our "distribution" code (`/dist`) which is actually shipped to the browser:

``` diff
webpack-demo
|- package.json
+ |- dist
+   |- index.html
- |- index.html
|- /src
  |- index.js
```

To bundle the `lodash` dependency with `index.js`, we'll need to install the library locally...

```bash
npm install --save lodash
```

and then import it from our script...

__src/index.js__

```diff
+ import _ from 'lodash';

function component () {
// ...
```

We also need to change our update our `<script>` tags to point to the unified bundle:

__dist/index.html__

```diff
 <html>
  <head>
    <title>webpack 2 demo</title>
-   <script src="https://unpkg.com/lodash@4.16.6"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
-   <script src="src/index.js"></script>
+   <script src="dist/bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
 </html>
```

In this setup, `index.js` explicitly requires `lodash` to be present, and binds it as `_` (no global scope pollution). By stating what dependencies a module needs, webpack can use this information to build a dependency graph. It then uses the graph to generate an optimized bundle where scripts will be executed in the correct order.

With that said, let's run `webpack` with our script as the [entry point](/concepts/entry-points) and `bundle.js` as the [output](/concepts/output):

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/webpack src/index.js dist/bundle.js

Hash: ff6c1d39b26f89b3b7bb
Version: webpack 2.2.0
Time: 385ms
    Asset    Size  Chunks                    Chunk Names
bundle.js  544 kB       0  [emitted]  [big]  main
   [0] ./~/lodash/lodash.js 540 kB {0} [built]
   [1] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 509 bytes {0} [built]
   [2] (webpack)/buildin/module.js 517 bytes {0} [built]
   [3] ./src/index.js 278 bytes {0} [built]
```

T> Output may vary. If the build is successful then you are good to go.

Open `index.html` in your browser and, if everything went right, you should see the following text: 'Hello webpack'.


## ES2015 Modules

Notice the use of [ES2015 module `import`](https://developer.mozilla.org//en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) (alias ES2015, *harmony*) in `src/index.js`? Although `import`/`export` statements are not supported in browsers (yet), webpack supports them and will replace those instructions with ES5 compatible wrapper code in the output. Inspect `dist/bundle.js` if you need to assure yourself.

Note that webpack will not alter any code other than `import` and `export` statements. In case you are using other [ES2015 features](http://es6-features.org/), make sure to use a transpiler such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [BublÃ©](https://buble.surge.sh/guide/). See our [Module API](/api/module-methods) documentation for information on the various module syntaxes supported by webpack.


## Using a Configuration

For a more complex setup, we can use a webpack [configuration file](/concepts/configuration). Let's add this file and represent the CLI command used above with some basic configuration:

``` diff
|- package.json
+ |- webpack.config.js
|- dist
  |- index.html
|- /src
  |- index.js
```

__webpack.config.js__

```javascript
var path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
};
```

Now, let's run the build again but instead using our new configuration:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js

Hash: ff6c1d39b26f89b3b7bb
Version: webpack 2.2.0
Time: 390ms
    Asset    Size  Chunks                    Chunk Names
bundle.js  544 kB       0  [emitted]  [big]  main
   [0] ./~/lodash/lodash.js 540 kB {0} [built]
   [1] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 509 bytes {0} [built]
   [2] (webpack)/buildin/module.js 517 bytes {0} [built]
   [3] ./src/index.js 278 bytes {0} [built]
```

T> If a `webpack.config.js` is present, `webpack` command picks it up by default. We use the `--config` option here only to show that you can pass a config of any name. This will come in useful for more complex configurations that need to be split into multiple files.

A configuration file allows far more flexibility than simple CLI usage. We can specify loader rules, plugins, resolve options and many other enhancements this way. See the [configuration documentation](/configuration) to learn more.


## NPM Scripts

Given it's not particularly fun to run a local copy of webpack from the CLI, we can set up a little shortcut. Let's adjust our _package.json_ by adding an [NPM script]():

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack"
  },
  ...
}
```


Now the `npm run build` command can be used in place of the longer commands we used earlier. Also note that within `scripts` we can reference local `node_modules` by name instead writing out the entire path. This convention is the standard in most npm-based projects.

T> You can pass custom parameters to webpack by adding two dashes to the `npm run build` command, e.g. `npm run build -- --colors`.


## Conclusion

Now that you have a basic build together, you should dig into the [basic concepts](/concepts) and [configuration](/configuration) to better understand webpack's design. The [API](/api) section digs into the various interfaces webpack offers. Or, if you'd prefer learning by example, select the next guide from the list and continue building out this little demo we've been working on -- which, if you've been paying attention, should now look like this:

``` diff
|- package.json
|- webpack.config.js
|- dist
  |- index.html
|- /src
  |- index.js
```
