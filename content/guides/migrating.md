## `resolve.root`, `resolve.fallback`, `resolve.modulesDirectories`

These options were replaced by a single option `resolve.modules`. See [resolving](/configuration/resolve) for more usage.

``` diff
  resolve: {
-   root: path.join(__dirname, "src")
+   modules: [
+     path.join(__dirname, "src"),
+     "node_modules"
+   ]
  }
```

## `resolve.extensions`

This option no longer requires passing an empty string. This behavior was moved to `resolve.enforceExtension`. See [resolving](/configuration/resolve) for more usage.

## `resolve.*`

More stuff was changed here. Not listed in detail as it's not commonly used. See [resolving](/configuration/resolve) for details.

## `module.loaders` is now `module.rules`

The old loader configuration was superseded by a more powerful rules system, which allows configuration of loaders and more.
For compatibility reasons, the old `module.loaders` syntax is still valid and the old names are parsed.
The new naming conventions are easier to understand and are a good reason to upgrade the configuration to using `module.rules`.

``` diff
  module: {
-   loaders: [
+   rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
-       loaders: [
+       use: [
          {
            loader: "style-loader"
          },
          {
            loader: "css-loader",
-           query: {
+           options: {
              modules: true
            }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Automatic `-loader` module name extension removed

It is not possible anymore to omit the `-loader` extension when referencing loaders:

``` diff
        loaders: [
-           "style",
+           "style-loader",
-           "css",
+           "css-loader",
-           "less",
+           "less-loader",
        ]
```

You can still opt-in to the old behavior with the resolveLoader.moduleExtensions configuration option.
``` javascript
resolveLoader: {
  moduleExtensions: ["-loader"]
}
```

See [#2986](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2986) for the reason behind this change.

## `json-loader` is not required anymore

When no loader has been configured for a JSON file, webpack will automatically try to load the JSON
file with the [json-loader](https://github.com/webpack/json-loader).

``` diff
-   {
-       test: /\.json/,
-       loader: "json-loader"
-   }
```

[We decided to do this](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/3363) in order to iron out environment differences
  between webpack and node.js/browserify.

## `module.preLoaders` and `module.postLoaders` was removed

``` diff
  module: {
-   preLoaders: [
+   rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
+       enforce: "pre",
        loader: "eslint-loader"
      }
    ]
  }
```

## `UglifyJsPlugin` sourceMap

The `sourceMap` option of the `UglifyJsPlugin` now defaults to `false` instead of `true`.
This means that if you are using source maps for minimized code, you need to set `sourceMap: true` for `UglifyJsPlugin`.

``` diff
  devtool: "source-map",
  plugins: [
    new UglifyJsPlugin({
+     sourceMap: true
    })
  ]
```

## `UglifyJsPlugin` minimize loaders

`UglifyJsPlugin` no longer switches loaders into minimize mode. The `minimize: true` setting needs to be passed via loader options in long-term. See loader documentation for relevant options.

The minimize mode for loaders will be removed in webpack 3 or later.

To keep compatibility with old loaders, loaders can be switched to minimize mode via plugin:

``` diff
  plugins: [
+   new webpack.LoaderOptionsPlugin({
+     minimize: true
+   })
  ]
```

## `OccurrenceOrderPlugin` is now on by default

It's no longer necessary to specify it in configuration.

``` diff
  plugins: [
-   new webpack.optimize.OccurrenceOrderPlugin()
  ]
```

## `ExtractTextWebpackPlugin` - breaking change

[ExtractTextPlugin](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin) 1.0.0 does not work with webpack v2. You will need to install ExtractTextPlugin v2 explicitly.

`npm install --save-dev extract-text-webpack-plugin@beta`

 The configuration changes for this plugin are mainly syntactical.

### `ExtractTextPlugin.extract`

```diff
module: {
  rules: [
    test: /.css$/,
-    loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract['css-loader']
+    loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({
+               fallbackLoader: "style-loader",
+               loader: "css-loader",
+               publicPath: "/dist" // Overrides output.publicPath
+     })
  ]
}
```

### `new ExtractTextPlugin({options})`

```diff
plugins: [
-  new ExtractTextPlugin("bundle.css", {allChunks: true, disable: false})
+  new ExtractTextPlugin({
+    filename: "bundle.css",
+    disable: false,
+    allChunks: true
+  })
]
```

## Full dynamic requires now fail by default

A dependency with only an expression (i. e. `require(expr)`) will now create an empty context instead of an context of the complete directory.

Best refactor this code as it won't work with ES2015 Modules. If this is not possible you can use the `ContextReplacementPlugin` to hint the compiler to the correct resolving.

?> Link to an article about dynamic dependencies.

### Using custom arguments in CLI and configuration

If you abused the CLI to pass custom arguments to the configuration like so:

`webpack --custom-stuff`

``` js
// webpack.config.js
var customStuff = process.argv.indexOf("--custom-stuff") >= 0;
/*...*/
```

You may notice that this is no longer allowed. The CLI is more strict now.

Instead there is an interface for passing arguments to the configuration. This should be used instead. Future tool may rely on this.

`webpack --env.customStuff`

``` js
module.exports = function(env) {
  var config, customStuff = env.customStuff;
  /*...*/
  return config;
};
```

See [CLI](/api/cli).

## `require.ensure` and AMD `require` is asynchronous

These functions are now always asynchronous instead of calling their callback sync if the chunk is already loaded.

## `LoaderOptionsPlugin` context

Some loaders need context information and read them from the configuration. This need to be passed via loader options in long-term. See loader documentation for relevant options.

To keep compatibility with old loaders, this information can be passed via plugin:

``` diff
  plugins: [
+   new webpack.LoaderOptionsPlugin({
+     options: {
+       context: __dirname
+     }
+   })
  ]
```

## `debug`

The `debug` option switched loaders to debug mode in webpack 1. This need to be passed via loader options in long-term. See loader documentation for relevant options.

The debug mode for loaders will be removed in webpack 3 or later.

To keep compatibility with old loaders, loaders can be switched to debug mode via plugin:

``` diff
- debug: true,
  plugins: [
+   new webpack.LoaderOptionsPlugin({
+     debug: true
+   })
  ]
```

### Code Splitting with ES2015

In webpack v1, you could use `require.ensure` as a method to lazily-load chunks for your application:

```javascript
require.ensure([], function(require) {
  var foo = require("./module");
});
```

The ES2015 Loader spec defines `import()` as method to load ES2015 Modules dynamically on runtime.

webpack treats `import()` as a split-point and puts the requested module in a separate chunk.

`import()` takes the module name as argument and returns a Promise.

``` js
function onClick() {
  import("./module").then(module => {
    return module.default;
  }).catch(err => {
    console.log("Chunk loading failed");
  });
}
```

Good news: Failure to load a chunk can be handled now because they are `Promise` based.

Caveat: `require.ensure` allows for easy chunk naming with the optional third argument, but `import` API doesn't offer that capability yet. If you want to keep that functionality, you can continue using `require.ensure`.

```javascript
require.ensure([], function(require) {
  var foo = require("./module");
}, 'custom-chunk-name');
```

(Note on the deprecated `System.import`: Webpack's use of `System.import` didn't fit the proposed spec, so it was deprecated in [v2.1.0-beta.28](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v2.1.0-beta.28) in favor of `import()`)

If you want to use `import` with [Babel](http://babeljs.io/), you'll need to install/add the [dynamic-import](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/syntax-dynamic-import/) syntax plugin while it's still Stage 3 to get around the parser error. When the proposal is added to the spec this won't be necessary anymore.

### Dynamic expressions

It's possible to pass a partial expression to `import()`. This is handled similar to expressions in CommonJS (webpack creates a [context](https://webpack.github.io/docs/context.html) with all possible files).

`import()` creates a separate chunk for each possible module.

``` js
function route(path, query) {
  return import("./routes/" + path + "/route")
    .then(route => new route.Route(query));
}
// This creates a separate chunk for each possible route
```

### Mixing ES2015 with AMD and CommonJS

As for AMD and CommonJS you can freely mix all three module types (even within the same file). Webpack behaves similar to babel in this case:

```javascript
// CommonJS consuming ES2015 Module
var book = require("./book");

book.currentPage;
book.readPage();
book.default === "This is a book";
```

```javascript
// ES2015 Module consuming CommonJS
import fs from "fs"; // module.exports map to default
import { readFileSync } from "fs"; // named exports are read from returned object+

typeof fs.readFileSync === "function";
typeof readFileSync === "function";
```

It is important to note that you will want to tell Babel to not parse these module symbols so webpack can use them. You can do this by setting the following in your `.babelrc` or babel-loader options.

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["es2015", { "modules": false }]
  ]
}
```
