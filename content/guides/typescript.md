[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. In this guide we will learn how to integrate Typescript with webpack.


## Basic Setup

In order to get started with webpack and Typescript, first we must [install webpack](/guides/installation/) in our project.

To start using webpack with Typescript you need a couple of things:

1. Install the Typescript compiler in your project.
2. Install a Typescript loader (in this case we're using ts-loader).
3. Create a __tsconfig.json__ file to contain our TypeScript compilation configuration.
4. Create __webpack.config.js__ to contain our webpack configuration.

You can install the TypeScript compiler and loader by running:

 ``` bash
 npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
 ```

__tsconfig.json__

Let's set up a simple configuration to support JSX and compile TypeScript down to ES5...

``` json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es5",
    "jsx": "react",
    "allowJs": true
  }
}
```

See [TypeScript's documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) to learn more about `tsconfig.json` configuration options.

__webpack.config.js__

Now let's configure webpack to handle TypeScript:

```js
module.exports = {
 entry: './index.ts',
 module: {
   rules: [
     {
       test: /\.tsx?$/,
       use: 'ts-loader',
       exclude: /node_modules/
     }
   ]
 },
 resolve: {
   extensions: [".tsx", ".ts", ".js"]
 },
 output: {
   filename: 'bundle.js',
   path: __dirname
 }
};
```

This will direct webpack to _enter_ through `./index.ts`, _load_ all `.ts` and `.tsx` files through the `ts-loader`, and _output_ a `bundle.js` file in our current directory.


## Loaders

The following loaders for TypeScript:

- [`awesome-typescript-loader`](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader)
- [`ts-loader`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader)

Awesome TypeScript Loader has created a [wonderful explanation](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader#differences-between-ts-loader) of the difference between `awesome-typescript-loader` and `ts-loader`.

We chose to use `ts-loader` in this guide as it makes enabling additional webpack features, such as importing other web assets, a bit easier.


## Source Maps

To enable source maps, we must configure TypeScript to output inline source maps to our compiled JavaScript files. The following line must be added to our `tsconfig.json`:

``` json
"sourceMap": true
```

Now we need to tell webpack to extract these source maps and into our final bundle:

__webpack.config.js__

```js
module.exports = {
 devtool: 'inline-source-map',
 // Remaining configuration...
};
```

See the [devtool documentation](/configuration/devtool/) for more information.


## Using 3rd Party Libraries

When installing 3rd party libraries from npm, it is important to remember to install the typing definition for that library. These definitions can be found in the [@types package](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).

For example if we want to install lodash we can run the following command to get the typings for it:

``` bash
npm install --save-dev @types/lodash
```

For more information see [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2016/06/15/the-future-of-declaration-files/).


## Importing Other Assets

To use non code assets with TypeScript, we need to defer the type for these imports. This requires a `custom.d.ts` file which signifies custom definitions for TypeScript in our project. Let's set up a declaration for `.svg` files:

__custom.d.ts__

```typescript
declare module "*.svg" {
  const content: any;
  export default content;
}
```

Here we declare a new module for SVGs by specifying any import that ends in `.svg` and defining the module's `content` as `any`. We could be more explicit about it being a url by defining the type as string. The same concept applies to other assets including CSS, SCSS, JSON and more.
