Loaders are transformations that are applied on a resource file of your application. They are functions (running in Node.js) that take the source of a resource file as the parameter and return the new source.

For example, you can use loaders to tell webpack to load a CSS file or to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.

## Loader Features

* Loaders can be chained. They are applied in a pipeline to the resource. A chain of loaders are compiled chronologically. The first loader in a chain of loaders returns a value to the next and at the end loader, webpack expects JavaScript to be returned.
* Loaders can be synchronous or asynchronous.
* Loaders run in Node.js and can do everything thatâ€™s possible there.
* Loaders accept query parameters. This can be used to pass configuration to the loader.
* Loaders can also be configured with an `options` object.
* Normal modules can export a loader in addition to the normal `main` via `package.json` with the `loader` field.
* Plugins can give loaders more features.
* Loaders can emit additional arbitrary files.

Loaders allow more power in the JavaScript ecosystem through preprocessing
functions (loaders). Users now have more flexibility to include fine-grained logic such as compression, packaging, language translations and [more](/loaders).

## Resolving Loaders

Loaders are [resolved similar to modules](/concepts/module-resolution/). A loader module is expected to export a function and to be written in Node.js compatible JavaScript. In the common case you manage loaders with npm, but you can also have loaders as files in your app.

### Referencing Loaders

By convention, loaders are usually named as `xxx-loader`, where `xxx` is the context name. For example, `babel-loader`.

In the following example, we will configure webpack to run all files which end with `.js` through the `babel-loader`.

All webpack loaders are standard npm modules and installed via npm from command line as follows:


## Usage

To set the `loader` property, you define the `module.rules` array value in your webpack config:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
const config = {
  ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {test: /\.js$/, loader: 'babel-loader', exclude: /node_modules/}, // transform js files
      {test: /\s[a|c]ss$/, loader: 'sass-loader'}                       // transform sass files
      {test: /\.css$/, loaders: ['style-loader','css-loader']}          // transform css files
    ]
  }
  ...
};
```
### Install Webpack Loader modules
Each of the specified rules requires one or more loaders.  In the `webpack.config.js` we referenced the following loaders
```
$ npm install --save-dev babel-loader css-loader style-loader sass-loader
```
## Options

The above example demonstrates the different approaches which can be used when defining the `module.rules` section of your `webpack.config.js` file.
For complete details, refer to [loaders section](/loaders).

### Omitting Loader Error

If you fail to define a loader for the desired files within your project, you will receive an error similar to the following:

`Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'sass-loader' in ...`

This can be cured by installing `sass-loader`

`$ npm install --save-dev sass-loader`

And referencing the loader within your `webpack.config.js`

```
...
module: {
  rules: [
    ...
    {test: /\s[a|c]ss$/, loader: 'sass-loader'}
    ...
  ]
}
...
```
### Loader Convention and Precedence
The loader name convention and precedence search order is defined by [`resolveLoader.moduleTemplates`](/configuration/resolve#resolveloader) within the webpack configuration API.
