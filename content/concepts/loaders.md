Loaders are transformations that are applied on a resource file of your application. They are functions (running in Node.js) that take the source of a resource file as the parameter and return the new source.

For example, you can use loaders to tell webpack to load a CSS file or to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.

## Loader Features

* Loaders can be chained. They are applied in a pipeline to the resource. A chain of loaders are compiled chronologically. The first loader in a chain of loaders returns an value to the next and at the end loader, webpack expects JavaScript to be returned.
* Loaders can be synchronous or asynchronous.
* Loaders run in Node.js and can do everything thatâ€™s possible there.
* Loaders accept query parameters. This can be used to pass configuration to the loader.
* Loaders can also be configured with an `options` object.
* Normal modules can export a loader in addition to the normal `main` via `package.json` with the `loader` field.
* Plugins can give loaders more features.
* Loaders can emit additional arbitrary files.

Loaders allows more power in the JavaScript ecosystem through preprocessing 
functions (loaders). Users now have more flexibility to include fine-grained logic such as compression, packaging, language translations and [more](/loaders).

## Resolving Loaders

Loaders are [resolved similar to modules](/concepts/module-resolution/). A loader module is expected to export a function and to be written in Node.js compatible JavaScript. In the common case you manage loaders with npm, but you can also have loaders as files in your app.

### Referencing Loaders

By convention, loaders are usually named as `XXX-loader`, where `XXX` is the context name. For example, `json-loader`.

The loader name convention and precedence search order is defined by [`resolveLoader.moduleTemplates`](/configuration/resolve#resolveloader) within the webpack configuration API.
