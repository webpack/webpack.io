# Module Federation

**TLDR** : Run the following commands in the root directory.

```
yarn install

yarn start (this should trigger the lerna command)
```
Both `app1` and `app2` are independently deployed app. In this example, `app1` imports `app2`.

`app1`: http://localhost:3001

`app2`: http://localhost:3002
